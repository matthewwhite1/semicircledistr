\details{
Density, distribution function, quantile function, and random generation for the semicircle distribution with parameters radius \code{R} and shift \code{a}.

This distribution is used to model random variables that follow the shape of a semicircle.

The semicircle distribution is defined over the interval \eqn{[a - R, a + R]}, where
\code{R} is the radius and \code{a} is the shift. The probability density function is:

\deqn{f(x) = \frac{2}{\pi R^2} \sqrt{R^2 - (x - a)^2},}
for \eqn{|x - a| \leq R}, and 0 otherwise.

The cumulative distribution function is the integral of the density function.

The quantile function gives the smallest value \code{x} such that the cumulative probability
\code{F(x)} is greater than or equal to a given probability \code{p}.
